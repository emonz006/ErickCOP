# About Me
Hello my name is Erick Monzon and I am currently a Sophmore at Florida International University. I am an Information Technology major and I currently know how to code in Java as well as some shell scripting and batch. It is to my hope to expand my programming skills to new languages and to become more proficient in the ones I already know. 

Two others technology related concepts that interest me are databases and virtual machines. I am currently taking a class to learn the basics of database management and have already taken one class that touched upon virtual machines. I feel that complete virtualization will be the future so it is very important to me to know about them.
